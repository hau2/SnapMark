# SnapMark

A cross-platform desktop screenshot and annotation app built with Electron.

Capture any region of your screen, annotate it with shapes, arrows, text, highlights, and pixelation, then copy to clipboard or save as PNG — all in one fluid workflow.

## Installation

### Download

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/hau2/SnapMark/releases) page and download the latest version:

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `SnapMark-x.x.x-universal.dmg` |
| Windows | `SnapMark-Setup-x.x.x.exe` |

### macOS — Bypass Gatekeeper

Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it on first launch. To open it:

1. **Right-click** (or Control+click) on `SnapMark.app`
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** again on the warning dialog

You only need to do this once. Alternatively:

1. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to find *"SnapMark.app was blocked"*
3. Click **"Open Anyway"**

### Windows

Run the `.exe` installer. If Windows Defender SmartScreen appears, click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"**.

## How It Works

1. **Capture** — The main window hides, waits 400ms (critical on macOS), then uses Electron's `desktopCapturer` at native resolution
2. **Select** — A fullscreen transparent overlay shows the screenshot. Drag to select a region with live dimension display
3. **Annotate** — A floating toolbar appears. Draw annotations on a separate canvas layer clipped to the selection
4. **Export** — Both canvas layers are merged and cropped to the selection. Copy to clipboard or save as PNG
5. **Gallery** — Screenshots are stored in the app's userData directory and displayed as thumbnails

## Creating a Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To publish a new version:

```bash
# Update version in package.json, then:
git add -A
git commit -m "release: v1.1.0"
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin master --tags
```

The workflow builds macOS (.dmg) and Windows (.exe) installers, then creates a GitHub Release with the artifacts attached.
